# graph_ql

<b>GraphQL</b> is a query language for your API in which clients can specify the structure of the data they need, and the server will return only the requested data. It allows for more efficient and flexible communication between the client and the server, as the client can request exactly what it needs and nothing more.

In Flutter, GraphQL can be used to interact with a GraphQL server from a Flutter app. There are several packages available that provide a simple and intuitive API for making queries, mutations, and subscriptions to a GraphQL server. These packages also provide features such as automatic caching, offline support, and real-time subscriptions.
